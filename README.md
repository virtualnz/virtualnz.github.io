# [virtual.gs](http://virtual.gs)

This is the source code repository of [virtual.gs](http://virtual.gs), which is hosted using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

## Things to note

- The code is *very* messy. I am not an experienced web developer by any means
- There are other peoples' code in this repository. For license information on their code see [here](http://virtual.gs/info)
- The website itself is more or less ducktaped together, so it may be buggy sorry!
